# IT6033-Student-Databse-Python-Assessment
Python Assessment for Data Structures and Analysis using different sort algorithms in a Student Database

*************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
OVERVIEW
In this Project Assessment, you are required to write software programs for a given set of requirements. The programs must use specified data structures and must follow the naming conventions provided. This task will allow you to demonstrate your ability to analyse a problem and choose appropriate data structures, algorithms, and software patterns to implement a solution.

This assessment contributes to 55% of the final course grade.

Learning Outcomes
This assessment contributes to the following course learning outcomes:

LO 1:   Analyse requirements, write fundamental data structures and develop relevant standard algorithms for accessing them. 
LO 3:  Analyse and apply software optimisation concepts and techniques on algorithms to work efficiently and minimise resource usage.   
LO 4:  Evaluate, apply and implement applicable software design patterns and write code following software development standards.
