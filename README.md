# IT6033-Student-Databse-Python-Assessment
<h2><i>Python Assessment for Data Structures and Analysis using different sort algorithms in a Student Database</h2> </i>

*************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
<h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
In this Project Assessment, you are required to write software programs for a given set of requirements. The programs must use specified data structures and must follow the naming conventions provided. This task will allow you to demonstrate your ability to analyse a problem and choose appropriate data structures, algorithms, and software patterns to implement a solution.
<br>
This assessment contributes to 55% of the final course grade.
<br>
<h5>Learning Outcomes</h5>
This assessment contributes to the following course learning outcomes:
<br>
<h6>LO 1:   Analyse requirements, write fundamental data structures and develop relevant standard algorithms for accessing them. <br>
LO 3:  Analyse and apply software optimisation concepts and techniques on algorithms to work efficiently and minimise resource usage.<br>   
LO 4:  Evaluate, apply and implement applicable software design patterns and write code following software development standards.<br></h6>
